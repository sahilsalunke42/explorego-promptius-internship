## 🧠 Approach

* I started by designing a **clean and minimal UI**, prioritizing responsive layout and user-friendly navigation.
* The **trip data** is stored as static JSON and fetched on-demand to simulate real APIs.
* **State is managed** using React's built-in hooks, while **filtering and rendering** use Array methods.
* I used **Framer Motion** to elevate the experience with micro-interactions and smooth page transitions.

## 🧪 Future Improvements

* Add step-by-step checkout form
* Integrate real payment gateway for full e-commerce simulation
* Add user authentication using Firebase/Auth0
