## 🧠 My Approach

This project was approached with the intent to simulate a real-world frontend application using best practices in modular React development. The focus areas were:

- Clean, readable, and reusable component structure  
- State-driven interactions and animations  
- User-centric UI/UX with consistent responsiveness  
- Minimalistic and modern design using Tailwind's utility classes  
- 3+ fully implemented pages as required: Home, Explore, and Search Results  

Authentication and protected routes were intentionally left out of this version to focus on core UI functionality. They can be easily added in future iterations.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/explorego.git
   cd explorego
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open in browser:  
   [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
